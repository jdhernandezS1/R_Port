        description: 'The purpose of the thesis was to develop and implement a microscope to develop some properties \
        using a test known as the contact angle of a drop of water. This test involves placing a drop of liquid on a material\
         and quickly measuring the contact that it has with the surface because as the material absorbs liquid, the algorithm \
         detects changes in the camera where the process has been taking place. ',
