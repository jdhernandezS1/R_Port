        // "The objective of this thesis was to design, develop, and implement a microscope capable of analyzing \
        // specific properties using the contact angle test with a drop of water. This test involves placing a liquid droplet on a\
        //  material and swiftly measuring the contact angle it forms with the surface. By monitoring the changes in the camera feed,\
        //   the algorithm detects variations in the contact angle as the material absorbs the liquid. \
        //   The microscope enables precise observation and measurement of these contact angle dynamics, providing valuable insights into material properties. \
        //   Through this research, I successfully contributed to the field by creating an advanced microscopy system that facilitates\
        //    accurate analysis and characterization of materials based on the contact angle phenomenon. ",
