        title: 'INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM FOR PROPERTIES MEASUREMENT IN POLYMERIC FILMS DEVELOPED TO PACK TROPICAL FRUITS.',
        description: "The objective of this thesis was to design, develop, and implement a microscope capable of analyzing \
        specific properties using the contact angle test with a drop of water. This test involves placing a liquid droplet on a\
         material and swiftly measuring the contact angle it forms with the surface. By monitoring the changes in the camera feed,\
          the algorithm detects variations in the contact angle as the material absorbs the liquid. \
          The microscope enables precise observation and measurement of these contact angle dynamics, providing valuable insights into material properties. \
          Through this research, I successfully contributed to the field by creating an advanced microscopy system that facilitates\
           accurate analysis and characterization of materials based on the contact angle phenomenon. ",
